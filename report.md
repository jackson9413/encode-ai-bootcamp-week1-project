- Please provide a dish name or ingredient(s) for dishes or a receipt for a dish:
- this is how I make fried rice: left over rice with scrumbled egges with bacon slicers with green onion
- Your method of making fried rice with scrambled eggs, bacon slices, and green onions is a good start, but I would suggest a couple of improvements to enhance the flavor and texture. First, I recommend cooking the bacon separatelst, I recommend cooking the bacon separately until crispy, then setting it aside to add back to the fried rice at the end. This will help retain the bacon's texture and prevent it from der adding a splash of soy sauce or oyster 
becoming soggy in the rice. Secondly, consider adding a splash of soy sauce or oyster sauce for an extra depth of flavor. Lastly, make sure the rice is properly seasoned with salt and pepper before adding the other ingredients. Enjoy your cooking!
